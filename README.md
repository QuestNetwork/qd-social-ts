## qDesk Profiles

## Description

qDesk Profiles is a module for qDesk. It's accessible across qDesk, you can use it with qDesk Messages, qDesk Market and other qDesk modules. If you integrate [Quest OS](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/quest-os-js) into your applications, you can even use the underlying channels and data in your own application. 

qDesk Profiles offers the ability to share posts and information about yourself and make connections with other people. You can have a public profile, granular privacy settings or invite only. qDesk Profiles is a module for [qDesk](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/qDesk) and it's built on [Quest OS](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/quest-os-js) which makes use of the [Interplanetary Filesystem](https://ipfs.io), [IPFS GossipSub](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-05-20-gossipsub-v1.1/) and [qDesk](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/qDesk), our window platform based on [Angular10](https://angular.io/).

We're not planning to make this a decentralized version of "Facebook" or "Twitter". We're crating the real deal and we feel like those premium platforms are more like the "for kids" version of what they should actually be.

[qDesk](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/qDesk) works in the browser, as an Electron on Windows, Mac and Linux and Android using Cordova.

## Development

qDesk Profiles is a module of [qDesk](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/qDesk), so please see https://github.com/QuestNetwork/qDesk#development for instructions.

### Commands

**Prepare Package**

``npm run inst`` Removes `package-lock.json` and runs ``npm install``

We added an example ```swarm.json``` to the ```src/app``` folder with an example node to make reproduction easier, but we strongly recommend to use our [Quest CLI](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/quest-cli) to test and build the app.

Pro Tip: Put a file in your `/bin` that runs the quest-cli like so `node /path/to/quest-cli/index.js` from any folder on your system. It's much nicer!
